# TODO

🎯: before launch

## Leetgolf
- make your own shareable problem
- Solver mode (although maybe just add a problem to LeetGolf.com)
- contest

## ArrayBox
- Add k6?

### Later
- Multi lang solve (get multiple bars)
- 🎯 Match on names across languages
  - rip apl cart / bqn crate (Adam's idea)
- add non-keyboard character set for APL, BQN, Kap
- train tacit view
- add shortcut for full docs
- add ctrl + shift + up/down for multi-line cursor for multi-line editing
- add alt + up/down

### Fix 
- jumpiness of logo in top left of keyboard
- syntax highlighting is a little slow on larger inputs
- missing glyphs docs from TinyAPL

### Image Fixes (non-essential)
- image of doublestruck letters doesn't work for BQN
- TinyAPL strings should not be yellow (in image)
- •listSys formatting in BQN
